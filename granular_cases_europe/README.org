* Quick explanation of the code
This folders contains csv files with different details (according to the
sources) about cases of infection in different countries, to a geographical
level more detailed than just country, as well as the code written in
Python 3 to extract and update the data.

** =first_scraping.py=

Code used for the creation of the first csv file.

Kept here for the record.

** Files per country

Each country has its own =country_update.py= file which contains the code
to update the =country.csv= file directly, via =country_update()= function.

** Countries included

    1) *Web Research:* The first step is to find a good source. Although there are a lot of websites with information per country and in each country, the ones with the data per region are rare. Even more rare the ones that provide the development of of the spread in time and per region.
    2) *Data scraping:* The next step is to do the data scraping. So far it all has been done using python 3.
    3) *First extraction* code is stored in a common file called =first_scraping.py= and the outcome is =Country_first.csv=. These files (py and csv) are kept independently for reproducibility and as a backup.
    4) *Automatising:* Once the first csv file is created, a python script is created for automation of the data scraping. The result is the code in =country_update.py= which updates the data stored in =Country.csv=.
    5) *Daily update:* The script =country_update.py= is run daily. It contains all details to make the function =country_update()= run properly.
    6) *Bugs:* If a bug is found, the best is to fix it immediately to keep the regularity of the updates. This means going back to steps *4* and *5* over again until the bug is fixed.
    7) The final result is a file per country, =Country.csv= containing granular data of =confirmed_cases=, =dead=, =recovered=, together with =timestamp= and in some cases few more details, according to the availability. 

* NOTES

** Lack of constancy for official data from Spain
Generally there is lack of constancy for the official data that we are scraping from Spain. Among others:
    - Sometimes they write the report with the current date for data from the day before, sometimes they write it with the date when the data was acquired. They specify it in the text but is hard to automatise.
